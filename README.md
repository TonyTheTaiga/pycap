Working on adding support for other OS's. Windows will not work as of now with how the API_KEY is exported, Linux might work.

**A coinmartketcap API Key**

Their public API shuts down in December.

sandbox = https://sandbox.coinmarketcap.com/

sandbox and live API keys are not interchangable.

# Installation

**As of now, this only works in a virtual enviroment in the project directory**

First, clone this repository and open up the directory in a terminal.

Next, run 'python3 -m venv env'. this should work in python2 as well.

Now, start the virtual enviroment by running 'source env/bin/activate'.

Your terminal should now look like something like '(env) pycap $ '.

Next, your going to need to export your API_KEY or update the config.py file.
API_KEY can be exported by running "export API_KEY='include-the-(')'" in the terminal.

Now run 'pip install --editable .' and this should install the script in the virtual enviroment.
