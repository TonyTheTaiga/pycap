## Installation

As of now you can only run this in a virtual enviroment.

First, clone this repository and open up the directory in a terminal.

Then, run 'python3 -m venv env'.

Now, start the virtual enviroment by running 'source env/bin/activate'.

Your terminal should now look like something like '(env) dir_name $ '.

Next, your going to need to export your API KEY or update the config.py file.
API key can be easily exported by running export API='your-api-key' after venv is running.

After this, run 'pip install --editable .' and this should install the script in the virtual enviroment.
